# Wine_quality_prediction_using_ML_Algorithms
This project aims to classify wine quality using different machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various features of the wine dataset, the project seeks to predict the quality of the wine, rated on a scale from 0 to 10, based on its physicochemical properties.
